life is all about "LL" the more u live,the more learn lesson.
"life is not an easy something"this a wise man bears in mind.
the glory of friendship in it isn't the outstreched hand nor the kindly smile neither is it the joy of companionship raher it is a spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he realizes that someone out here loves him/her and is willing to start up a friendship with him/her,a unique one at that.Friends stands with each other through thick and tin@whenever you need me as a friend,i will surely be there for you.Best friends that's our pride!
